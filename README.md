## Stream

1. A source of asynchronous data events.
2. You listen on a stream to make it start generating events,
and to set up listeners that receive the events.
3. You can process a stream using either await for or listen() from the Stream API.
4. There are two kinds of streams: single subscription or broadcast.

## Provider

1. You can use it to provide a value (usually a data model object) to anywhere in the widget tree.
2. However, it won't help you update the widget tree when that value changes.
